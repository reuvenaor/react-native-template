# React Native Template Expo Modules

This project includes Expo modules support to leverage the best of both worlds. This hybrid approach allows us to:

- Use Expo's pre-built native modules without ejecting
- Maintain full control over native code when needed
- Access Expo's development tools and services
- Easily integrate new Expo modules as they become available

This template implements the following libraries with examples and configurations:

Navigation:

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### For Android

```bash
npm run android
```

### For iOS

First, install the pods:

```bash
npm run ios:pod-install
```

Then, run the iOS app:

```bash
npm run ios
```

## Optional Feature Modules

This template includes three optional feature modules that can be enabled or disabled independently:

### ðŸ¤– Chat AI Module

**AI with ExecuTorch** - **works best on real high-tier devices**

[![react-native-executorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/react--native--executorch-0.4.6-blue)](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch)

AI chat functionality with ExecuTorch integration for on-device inference.

### ðŸ”„ Redux Module

State management examples with Redux Toolkit, including counter examples and middleware demonstrations.

### ðŸŽ¨ Skia Accelerometer Module

Interactive graphics using React Native Skia combined with device accelerometer sensors for motion-based animations.

### Module Management

```bash
# Interactive module setup
npm run modules:setup

# Check status of all modules
npm run modules:status

# Enable specific modules
npm run modules:enable chat-ai-screen

# Disable specific modules
npm run modules:disable chat-ai-screen
```

Each module is implemented as a separate React Native library that can be linked/unlinked independently. When disabled, modules show placeholder screens with re-enabling instructions. This modular approach helps reduce bundle size and dependencies when features aren't needed.

## App Icons and Splash Screens

This template includes custom scripts to generate app icons and splash screens for both iOS and Android:

### Generate icons and splash screens for bare React Native with Expo modules

```bash
npm run icons:generate
```

This script generates:

- App icons for Android in various densities (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi)
- Round icons for Android
- App icons for iOS in all required dimensions
- Splash screen images for Android
- Splash screen background color for iOS
- Standard Expo assets in the assets/ directory for compatibility

### Generate iOS splash screen logo

```bash
npm run icons:splash-logo
```

This script generates:

- iOS splash screen logo image in 1x, 2x, and 3x resolutions
- Updates the necessary Contents.json file

### Additional Commands

```bash
# Check Expo installation
npm run expo:doctor

# Check for package updates
npm run expo:check

# Clean and refresh the project
npm run refresh

# Clean iOS build
npm run ios:clean

# Clean Android build
npm run android:clean

# Get iOS devices
npm run ios:devices

# Get Android devices
npm run android:devices
```
